# Information
Small Game I made in 9th grade. There are two characters. The first one is controlled by WASD+Shift, and the second is controlled by the arrow keys+Space. 
## Controls
`WASD` is used for player 1 movement. Arrow Keys are used for player 2 movement.  
`SHIFT` is used for firing player 1's laser. `SPACEBAR` is used for firing player 2's laser.
